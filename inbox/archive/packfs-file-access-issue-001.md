# PackFS Initialization Configuration Issue Report

**Date:** 2025-06-20  
**Reporter:** PackFS Test Client Project  
**PackFS Version:** @packfs-core 0.1.15  
**Environment:** Mastra Framework v0.10.6, Node.js v22.9.0  

## Executive Summary

The PackFS semantic filesystem tool requires specific initialization parameters that are not documented in the basic integration examples. Without proper initialization, PackFS returns the error: "Filesystem is not initialized. Please provide a valid filesystem or workingDirectory."

## Issue Description

When creating a PackFS tool using `createMastraSemanticFilesystemTool()` without configuration parameters, the tool initializes successfully but fails during execution with filesystem initialization errors. This occurs because:
- The tool requires either a `filesystem` object or `workingDirectory` parameter
- The default initialization (with empty config) does not set up the filesystem backend
- The error only appears at runtime when attempting file operations

## Reproduction Steps

1. Create a Mastra agent that uses the PackFS tool:
```typescript
import { createMastraSemanticFilesystemTool } from 'packfs-core';

export const packfsTool = createMastraSemanticFilesystemTool({
  // No additional configuration provided
});
```

2. Register the tool with a Mastra agent:
```typescript
export const contextNetworkAgent = new Agent({
  name: 'context-network-agent',
  description: 'Agent for navigating and understanding context network structures',
  model: groq,
  tools: { packfsTool },
});
```

3. Have the agent attempt to read a file that exists:
   - Target file: `/workspaces/packfs-test-client/context-network/discovery.md`
   - File confirmed to exist and be readable via Node.js fs module

4. Observe the failure

## Log Evidence

Direct testing of PackFS reveals the actual error:

### Test Command
```typescript
const result = await packfsTool.execute({
  naturalLanguageQuery: 'read the discovery.md file in the context network folder'
});
```

### PackFS Error Response
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Filesystem is not initialized. Please provide a valid filesystem or workingDirectory."
}
```

This error occurs for all operations:
- Reading files
- Listing directories  
- Accessing files with absolute paths

The error is consistent and indicates a missing initialization parameter.

## Technical Context

### Working Directory
- Application working directory: `/workspaces/packfs-test-client/packfs-test-client`
- Context network location: `/workspaces/packfs-test-client/context-network`
- Both absolute and relative paths were attempted

### Integration Method
```typescript
// From packfs-test-client/src/mastra/tools/packfsTool.ts
import { createMastraSemanticFilesystemTool } from 'packfs-core';

export const packfsTool = createMastraSemanticFilesystemTool({
  // Optional configuration can be added here if needed
});
```

### Agent Configuration
The agent is provided with:
- Full absolute paths to files
- Clear instructions about file locations
- Proper tool registration

## Expected vs Actual Behavior

**Expected:** The example code `createMastraSemanticFilesystemTool({})` should either:
1. Work with sensible defaults, OR
2. Throw an error at initialization time indicating required parameters

**Actual:** The tool initializes successfully but fails at runtime with "Filesystem is not initialized" errors.

## Root Cause

The `createMastraSemanticFilesystemTool` function requires configuration that is not obvious from the function signature or basic examples:

```typescript
// Current (failing) implementation:
export const packfsTool = createMastraSemanticFilesystemTool({});

// Required implementation:
export const packfsTool = createMastraSemanticFilesystemTool({
  workingDirectory: '/path/to/working/directory'
  // OR
  filesystem: new DiskSemanticBackend('/path/to/root')
});
```

## Impact

1. **Developer Experience:** Developers following basic examples will encounter runtime errors
2. **Debugging Difficulty:** The error message doesn't clearly indicate what configuration is missing
3. **Documentation Gap:** The requirement for workingDirectory/filesystem is not documented in basic usage examples

## Recommendations

1. **Improve Error Messages:** Change "Filesystem is not initialized" to include guidance like "Please provide workingDirectory or filesystem in the configuration"
2. **Add Initialization Validation:** Throw an error during tool creation if required parameters are missing
3. **Update Documentation:** Include the workingDirectory requirement in all basic examples
4. **Consider Defaults:** Use process.cwd() as a default workingDirectory if none is provided

## Test Environment Details

- OS: Linux 6.10.14-linuxkit
- Node.js: v22.9.0
- Mastra: v0.10.6
- PackFS: @packfs-core v0.1.15
- Project structure: Monorepo with context-network at parent level

## Discovery Process

This issue was initially masked by the agent's generic error handling. The actual PackFS error was discovered by:
1. Creating a direct test that bypasses the agent layer
2. Logging the raw PackFS tool responses
3. Identifying that the parameter name was `naturalLanguageQuery` not `command`
4. Finally revealing the underlying "Filesystem is not initialized" error

This highlights the importance of clear error propagation through integration layers.

This report documents issue #001 encountered during PackFS evaluation testing. The issue is not a bug in PackFS functionality but rather a gap in initialization requirements and documentation.
