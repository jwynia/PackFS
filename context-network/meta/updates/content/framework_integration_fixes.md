# Framework Integration Fixes

## Purpose

This document details the fixes implemented to address critical issues in the framework integrations (LangChain.js, LlamaIndex.TS, and KaibanJS) related to filesystem initialization checks.

## Classification

- **Domain:** Implementation
- **Stability:** Semi-stable

### Issue Description

After fixing the Mastra integration in version 0.1.12, we discovered similar issues in other framework integrations. The integrations were not properly checking if the `config.filesystem` property was initialized before attempting to use it, which could lead to runtime errors like "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'accessFile')".

### Implemented Fixes

1. **LangChain.js Integration**

   - Added null checks for `config.filesystem` in all methods that access filesystem operations
   - Improved error messages to clearly indicate when filesystem is not initialized
   - Standardized error handling across all methods

2. **LlamaIndex.TS Integration**

   - Added null checks for `config.filesystem` in executeNaturalLanguageQuery, executeSemanticIntent, executeStructuredAction, and tool functions
   - Enhanced error messages with clear instructions for proper initialization
   - Ensured consistent error handling patterns

3. **KaibanJS Integration**
   - Verified existing null checks for `config.filesystem` (already implemented)
   - Ensured consistent error handling with other integrations

### Implementation Details

The fix pattern implemented across all integrations follows this structure:

```typescript
// Before accessing config.filesystem
if (!config.filesystem) {
  throw new Error(
    'Filesystem is not initialized. Please provide a valid filesystem or workingDirectory.'
  );
}

// Then proceed with the filesystem operation
const result = await config.filesystem.someOperation({...});
```

This pattern ensures that:

1. The code fails early with a clear error message
2. The error message provides guidance on how to fix the issue
3. The pattern is consistent across all framework integrations

### Testing

The fixes were tested by:

1. Verifying TypeScript compilation with no type errors
2. Ensuring consistent error handling across all integrations
3. Confirming that proper error messages are provided when filesystem is not initialized
