### Update Summary
Conducted comprehensive research into TypeScript NPM package best practices for LLM framework compatibility, specifically focusing on Mastra integration requirements. The research findings were documented in ADR-001, establishing the technical foundation for PackFS package configuration.

### Research Scope
The research covered:

1. **Mastra Framework Requirements**
   - Module format preferences (ESM vs CommonJS)
   - TypeScript configuration expectations
   - Integration patterns and tool definitions
   - Dependency management approaches

2. **Modern TypeScript NPM Package Best Practices**
   - Dual module output strategies
   - Package.json export field configuration
   - TypeScript compilation targets and module resolution
   - Build tooling options and trade-offs

3. **LLM Framework Ecosystem Analysis**
   - Common patterns across frameworks (LangChain, AutoGPT, CrewAI, Semantic Kernel)
   - Framework-specific adapter requirements
   - Type definition expectations
   - Performance and compatibility considerations

### Key Findings

#### Mastra Compatibility Requirements
- Prefers ESM modules with modern TypeScript
- Expects framework-specific adapters as separate entry points
- Requires comprehensive type definitions
- Uses async/await patterns extensively
- Integrates with @mastra/client-js for agent interactions

#### Industry Best Practices
- Dual module output (ESM + CommonJS) maximizes compatibility
- Package.json exports field enables multiple entry points
- TypeScript NodeNext module resolution supports modern patterns
- Separate tsconfig files allow format-specific optimization
- Framework adapters should follow consistent patterns

#### Technical Decisions
- Target ES2020 for broad compatibility
- Use TypeScript compiler with multiple configurations
- Implement three-tier build process (clean, ESM, CJS)
- Provide framework-specific entry points
- Include comprehensive type definitions

### Documentation Created

#### ADR-001: TypeScript NPM Package Setup for Mastra Compatibility
**Location:** `context-network/decisions/adr_001_typescript_npm_package_setup_for_mastra_compatibility.md`

**Content Includes:**
- Detailed context and problem statement
- Comprehensive decision rationale
- Analysis of alternatives considered
- Implementation notes and patterns
- Compliance verification criteria
- Relationships to other context network nodes

**Key Sections:**
- Status: Accepted
- Context: Module format conflicts and framework requirements
- Decision: Dual-module TypeScript package with framework adapters
- Consequences: Benefits, drawbacks, and trade-offs analysis
- Alternatives: Four alternatives evaluated and rejected
- Implementation: Detailed technical specifications

### Context Network Integration

#### New Nodes Created
- `decisions/adr_001_typescript_npm_package_setup_for_mastra_compatibility.md`

#### Nodes Updated
- `decisions/decision_index.md` - Added ADR-001 to all relevant sections

#### Relationships Established
