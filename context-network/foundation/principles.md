# PackFS Design Principles

## Purpose
This document outlines the core principles and standards that guide decision-making and development for PackFS - an NPM package providing filesystem access for LLM agent frameworks.

## Classification

### Core Values

These fundamental values drive PackFS development:

1. **Safety First**
   Filesystem access inherently carries security risks. Every design decision must prioritize safety and security, with multiple layers of protection against destructive operations and unauthorized access.

2. **LLM-Centric Design**
   All interfaces, error messages, and operations must be designed specifically for LLM agent comprehension and effective use, not just human developers.

3. **Intelligent Content Management**
   Files often exceed LLM context windows. PackFS must intelligently handle large content through semantic chunking, summarization, and preview generation.

4. **Framework Agnostic**
   PackFS provides clean, composable interfaces that work with any agent framework, avoiding lock-in to specific implementations.

5. **Performance Awareness**
   Filesystem operations can be expensive. PackFS must optimize for performance through intelligent caching, async patterns, and efficient content processing.

### Design Principles

These key principles guide PackFS design decisions:

1. **Semantic Awareness**
   Operations understand content meaning, not just file paths. PackFS analyzes file content to provide intelligent chunking, summarization, and metadata extraction.
   
   *Example:* When reading a large document, PackFS automatically detects semantic boundaries and provides structured chunks rather than arbitrary byte ranges.

2. **Context Window Optimization**
   All operations are designed with LLM context window limitations in mind. Large files are intelligently processed to fit within available context.
   
   *Example:* Files larger than 32KB trigger automatic preview generation with key statistics, structure analysis, and semantic summaries.

3. **Multiple Defense Layers**
   Security is implemented through multiple independent layers: path validation, sandboxing, permission systems, and virtual filesystems.
   
   *Example:* Even if path validation fails, sandboxing prevents access outside allowed directories, and permissions limit operation types.

4. **Interface-Driven Architecture**
   Clean abstractions enable pluggable backends and framework integrations without coupling to specific implementations.
   
   *Example:* The same PackFS interface works with memory, disk, or cloud storage backends, and integrates consistently across different agent frameworks.

5. **Graceful Degradation**
   When optimal operations aren't possible, PackFS degrades gracefully while maintaining functionality and providing clear feedback.
   
   *Example:* If semantic chunking fails, fall back to fixed-size chunking; if file access fails, provide cached metadata; if all else fails, return structured error information.

### Standards and Guidelines

These standards and guidelines apply specifically to PackFS development:

#### API Design Standards

- All operations must return structured results with consistent error handling
- Error messages must be LLM-friendly with recovery suggestions and context
- Interfaces must be TypeScript-first with comprehensive type definitions
- Operations must be async/await compatible with proper Promise handling
- All public APIs must include JSDoc documentation with examples

#### Security Standards

- Path validation must prevent directory traversal attacks through multiple checks
- All file operations must respect configured permission boundaries
- Sandboxing must be enforced at the filesystem backend level
- Virtual filesystems must be used for testing and untrusted operations
- Security decisions must include threat models and mitigation strategies

#### Performance Standards

- File operations must complete within 1 second for files under 10MB
- Caching must reduce repeated filesystem operations by at least 60%
- Memory usage must remain bounded even for large file operations
- Concurrent operations must be supported without blocking
- Performance metrics must be tracked and reported

#### Content Processing Standards

- Semantic chunking must maintain coherence with 0.75+ similarity thresholds
- Preview generation must complete within 500ms for common file types
- Binary file handling must support 1000+ formats through Apache Tika
- Metadata extraction must provide structured, searchable information
- Large file processing must not exceed available memory limits

### Process Principles

These principles guide development and operational processes:

1. **Code-Documentation Synchronization**
   Establish mechanisms to keep documentation in sync with code changes, including automated checks and manual reviews.

2. **Knowledge Gardening**
   Regularly maintain and refactor the context network to keep it relevant and useful, with scheduled sessions for updates.

3. **Feedback Loops**
   Create explicit feedback loops between implementation experiences and planning artifacts to capture learning.

4. **Incremental Improvement**
   Start with essential documentation and improve incrementally rather than aiming for perfect documentation.

5. **Collaborative Maintenance**
   Make context network maintenance a team responsibility, not assigned to a single individual.

### Decision-Making Framework

The framework for making PackFS-specific decisions:

#### Decision Criteria

- **Security Impact**: Does this decision introduce or mitigate security risks?
- **LLM Compatibility**: How well does this work with LLM agent patterns and limitations?
- **Performance Implications**: What are the performance characteristics and trade-offs?
- **Framework Integration**: How does this affect integration with different agent frameworks?
- **Maintenance Burden**: What ongoing maintenance will this require?
- **User Experience**: How does this impact developers using PackFS?

#### Trade-off Considerations

- **Security vs. Performance**: More security checks may slow operations
- **Simplicity vs. Intelligence**: Smart features add complexity but improve usability
- **Memory vs. Speed**: Caching improves speed but uses memory
- **Generality vs. Optimization**: Generic interfaces vs. format-specific optimizations
- **Safety vs. Flexibility**: Strict sandboxing vs. operational flexibility

### Principle Application

How these principles should be applied in PackFS development:

#### When Principles Conflict

When principles conflict, prioritize based on:
1. **Safety First**: Security and data protection always take precedence
2. **LLM Agent Needs**: Optimize for agent comprehension and effective use
3. **Framework Compatibility**: Maintain broad framework support over specific optimizations
4. **Performance Requirements**: Meet performance standards while maintaining safety
5. **Developer Experience**: Balance ease of use with powerful capabilities

#### Exceptions to Principles

Exceptions may be considered under these circumstances:
- **Performance Critical Paths**: Where strict adherence would cause unacceptable performance
- **Legacy System Integration**: When working with existing systems that don't follow modern patterns
- **Experimental Features**: During research phases with clear documentation of deviations
- **Emergency Security Fixes**: When immediate action is required to address vulnerabilities
