# ADR-002: Minimum Viable Package Implementation

## Status
Accepted and Implemented

## Context
Following ADR-001's decision on TypeScript NPM package setup, we needed to implement a minimum viable package (MVP) that demonstrates the core concepts and provides a foundation for future development. This ADR documents the key implementation decisions made during the initial development phase.

## Decision

### Core Architecture Decisions

1. **Abstract Class for FileSystem Interface**
   - Used abstract class instead of TypeScript interface
   - Provides both contract definition and potential for shared functionality
   - Enables better IDE support and runtime type checking

2. **Configuration Object Pattern**
   - All major classes accept configuration objects
   - Provides flexibility and extensibility
   - Makes testing easier with different configurations

3. **Readonly Properties**
   - All configuration properties marked as `readonly`
   - Prevents accidental mutation
   - Clearer API contracts

### Security Implementation

1. **Multi-Layer Security**
   - Path validation as first layer
   - Blocked paths checking
   - Extension filtering
   - File size validation
   - Each layer can be independently configured

2. **Fail-Safe Defaults**
   - Operations denied by default if validation fails
   - Empty allowlist means all extensions allowed (explicit opt-in)
   - Path traversal always blocked

3. **Separate Security Concerns**
   - PathValidator handles path normalization
   - SecurityEngine handles policy enforcement
   - Clear separation of responsibilities

### Module System

1. **Import Paths Without Extensions**
   - Source files use imports without `.js` extension
   - Build process maintains compatibility
   - Better for Jest testing and TypeScript tooling

2. **Explicit Type Exports**
   - Types exported separately from implementations
   - Clearer API surface
   - Better tree-shaking support

3. **Barrel Exports**
   - Each module has an index.ts with explicit exports
   - Central index.ts re-exports everything
   - Framework-specific entry points

### Testing Strategy

1. **Jest with TypeScript**
   - Direct TypeScript execution in tests
   - No need for build step during testing
   - Faster test development cycle

2. **Integration-Style Unit Tests**
   - Test public APIs rather than internals
   - Use real implementations where possible
   - MemoryBackend for isolated testing

3. **Comprehensive Security Testing**
   - Explicit tests for path traversal
   - Extension filtering validation
   - Size limit enforcement

### Error Handling

1. **Descriptive Error Messages**
   - Include context about what failed
   - Security errors don't reveal system details
   - Consistent error format

2. **Result Objects for Validation**
   - ValidationResult includes success/failure
   - Optional error message
   - Optional normalized path

3. **Promise-Based Async Errors**
   - All async operations return promises
   - Errors rejected with Error instances
   - No callback-style APIs

### Content Processing

1. **Configurable Chunking**
   - All parameters configurable
   - Sensible defaults (4000 chars, 200 overlap)
   - Metadata about chunking results

2. **Semantic Boundaries**
   - Prefer paragraph boundaries
   - Fall back to sentences
   - Ultimate fallback to character limit

3. **Infinite Loop Prevention**
   - Always make progress in chunking
   - Explicit guards against edge cases
   - Tested with pathological inputs

## Consequences

### Benefits

1. **Type Safety**
   - Full TypeScript strict mode catches many errors
   - Configuration objects provide clear contracts
   - Abstract classes enforce implementation requirements

2. **Security First**
   - Multiple validation layers provide defense in depth
   - Clear security boundaries
   - Easy to audit security policies

3. **Testability**
   - Configuration objects make testing easier
   - MemoryBackend enables fast, isolated tests
   - Clear interfaces simplify mocking

4. **Extensibility**
   - New backends can be added easily
   - New processors follow established patterns
   - Framework integrations have clear template

### Drawbacks

1. **Bundle Size**
   - Dual module system increases package size
   - All backends included even if not used
   - Type declarations add overhead

2. **Complexity**
   - Multiple configuration files for builds
   - Abstract patterns may be overkill for simple use cases
   - Learning curve for contributors

3. **Limited Features**
   - No streaming support yet
   - No transaction support
   - Basic error handling

### Technical Debt

1. **Framework Integration Stubs**
   - Current integrations are placeholders
   - Need real implementation with framework APIs
   - May need refactoring once real requirements known

2. **Missing Base Classes**
   - Backends duplicate some logic
   - Could extract BaseBackend class
   - Processor base class would reduce duplication

3. **Limited Binary Support**
   - Only text processing implemented
   - Binary file handling needs design
   - Large file streaming not implemented

## Migration Path

From the current MVP to full implementation:

1. **Phase 1: Complete Stubs**
   - Implement real framework integrations
   - Add missing processor types
   - Complete error handling

2. **Phase 2: Performance**
   - Add streaming support
   - Implement caching layer
   - Optimize chunk processing

3. **Phase 3: Advanced Features**
   - Cloud backend support
   - Virtual filesystem
   - Transaction support
