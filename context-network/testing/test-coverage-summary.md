## Coverage by Component

### High Coverage (>80%)
- **ErrorRecoveryEngine**: 83% statements, 71% branches
- **Logger**: ~45% (with focused usage)
- **Framework Integrations**: Well tested with multiple scenarios

### Medium Coverage (50-80%)
- **Semantic Backends**: Partial coverage, focusing on main paths
- **Processors**: Core functionality tested

### Low Coverage (<50%)
- **Compression strategies**: Basic tests only
- **Enhanced filesystem**: Minimal coverage

## Running Tests

### All Tests
```bash
npm test
```

### Specific Test File
```bash
npm test -- tests/semantic/error-recovery.test.ts
```

### With Coverage
```bash
npm test -- --coverage
```

### Watch Mode
```bash
npm test -- --watch
```

## Test Patterns

### Integration Tests
- Each framework integration has comprehensive tests
- Tests cover initialization, operations, and error cases
- Mock implementations for framework-specific APIs

### Unit Tests
- Focus on individual component functionality
- Use temporary directories for file operations
- Clean up resources in afterEach hooks

### Common Test Utilities
- Temporary directory creation in os.tmpdir()
- Async beforeEach/afterEach for setup/cleanup
- Descriptive test names following "should..." pattern

## Known Issues
1. Memory backend test occasionally flaky
2. Coverage reporting includes some build artifacts
3. Benchmark scripts have TypeScript errors (not critical)

## Maintenance Notes
- Tests should be updated when adding new features
- Each new semantic operation needs test coverage
- Framework integration tests should cover all exposed methods
- Error cases are as important as success cases
