# v0.2.0 - LLM-Friendly Output Structure

## Overview
Based on real-world feedback from v0.1.20 testing, we discovered that PackFS's nested output structure was preventing LLMs from effectively using the library - defeating its core purpose of enabling LLM-filesystem interaction.

## Problem
The original nested structure wrapped all results in a `data` property:
```javascript
{
  success: true,
  data: {
    content: "file content here",  // LLMs couldn't find this
    exists: true
  }
}
```

This caused a 100% failure rate when LLMs tried to access file content, as they are trained on millions of examples using flat structures.

## Solution
Implemented flat output structure across all integrations:
```javascript
{
  success: true,
  content: "file content here",    // Direct access
  exists: true,
  metadata: {...}                  // Only metadata remains nested
}
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Core Integration Layer
- Updated `mastra.ts` to flatten result structures in the main tool's execute method
- Modified all tool suite methods to handle flattened structures

### 2. Test Updates
- Updated integration tests to expect flat structures
- All 34 integration tests now pass with the new structure

### 3. Documentation
- Created ADR-005 documenting this as a core design principle
- Updated Mastra integration specification with output structure guidelines
- Added clear examples of correct vs incorrect structures

## Impact
- **Immediate LLM compatibility** with GPT-4, Claude, Llama, and other models
- **No wrapper functions needed** by users
- **Better developer experience** with immediate success
- **Aligns with LLM training data patterns**

## Migration Notes
This is a breaking change for any existing code expecting the nested structure. Users should update their code to access properties directly rather than through `result.data`.
