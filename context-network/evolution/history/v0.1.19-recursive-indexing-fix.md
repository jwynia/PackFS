# v0.1.19 - Recursive Directory Indexing Fix

**Date:** 2025-06-20
**Type:** Bug Fix
**Priority:** Critical

## Summary

Fixed a critical bug in PackFS where the DiskSemanticBackend would encounter infinite recursion errors when indexing directories during initialization. The issue prevented PackFS from initializing in real-world project structures that contain circular symlinks, deep directory trees, or large directories like node_modules.

## Context

Two issues were reported in the /inbox:
1. Documentation/ease of use issue regarding missing initialization parameters
2. Critical bug: infinite recursion during directory indexing

This fix addresses the second issue, which was preventing PackFS from working in typical development environments.

## Changes Made

### DiskSemanticBackend Protection Mechanisms

1. **Added Excluded Directories List**
   - Common directories that should not be indexed: node_modules, .git, .svn, dist, build, etc.
   - Prevents indexing of large dependency directories and version control folders

2. **Implemented Depth Limit**
   - Maximum indexing depth of 10 levels to prevent stack overflow
   - Logs warning when depth limit is reached

3. **Added Circular Symlink Protection**
   - Tracks visited paths using real path resolution
   - Prevents infinite loops from circular symbolic links

4. **Updated All Recursive Methods**
   - `indexDirectory()` - Added depth parameter and visited path tracking
   - `hasModificationsSince()` - Added depth limit and exclusion handling
   - `updateIndexIfNeeded()` - Clears visited paths before re-indexing

### Test Coverage

Added comprehensive tests to verify the fix:
- Test for skipping excluded directories (node_modules, .git)
- Test for handling deep directory structures without stack overflow
- Both tests pass successfully

## Technical Details

```typescript
// New protection mechanisms
private readonly excludedDirectories = new Set([
  'node_modules', '.git', '.svn', /* ... */
]);
private readonly maxIndexingDepth = 10;
private visitedPaths = new Set<string>();

// Example of protected recursion
private async indexDirectory(dirPath: string, depth: number = 0): Promise<void> {
  if (depth >= this.maxIndexingDepth) {
    this.logger.warn(`Skipping directory due to depth limit: ${dirPath}`);
    return;
  }
  
  const realPath = await fs.realpath(dirPath);
  if (this.visitedPaths.has(realPath)) {
    this.logger.debug(`Skipping already visited directory: ${dirPath}`);
    return;
  }
  
  this.visitedPaths.add(realPath);
  // ... rest of indexing logic
}
```

## Impact

This fix enables PackFS to:
- Initialize successfully in real-world project structures
- Handle projects with node_modules and other large directories
- Work with repositories containing symbolic links
- Prevent stack overflow errors in deeply nested directory structures

## Testing

All existing tests continue to pass, and new tests verify:
- Excluded directories are properly skipped
- Deep directory structures are handled gracefully
- No regression in existing functionality

## Documentation Improvements

Also addressed the documentation issue (packfs-file-access-issue-001.md) in this release:

1. **Updated Main README.md**
   - Added clear examples showing the required `workingDirectory` parameter
   - Separated Mastra integration into two patterns with explicit parameter documentation

2. **Enhanced Mastra Integration README**
   - Added prominent warning section about required parameters
   - Included the specific error message users will see
   - Provided multiple initialization examples

3. **Created Getting Started Guide**
   - New comprehensive guide at `docs/GETTING_STARTED.md`
   - Focuses on initialization requirements as the #1 issue
   - Includes debugging tips and common patterns
   - Links to framework-specific guides

4. **Improved Error Messages**
   - Enhanced error messages to provide actionable guidance
   - Includes example configurations directly in error text
   - Links to documentation for more help

## Release Summary

Version 0.1.19 addresses both critical issues reported:
1. ✅ Fixed recursive directory indexing causing stack overflow
2. ✅ Documented initialization requirements clearly

Both issues have comprehensive test coverage and documentation.
