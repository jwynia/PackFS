### Task Overview

**Date:** 2025-06-24
**Task:** Design and plan CamaDB backend implementation
**Status:** Completed
**Requestor:** User inquiry about MongoDB-like backend using CamaDB

### Work Completed

1. **Research Phase**
   - Analyzed existing backend architecture in PackFS
   - Researched CamaDB features and capabilities
   - Identified integration points and requirements

2. **Design Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive design document at [architecture/camadb_backend_design.md]
   - Defined document schema for file storage
   - Specified advanced features (queries, tags, aggregations)
   - Addressed multi-environment support

3. **Implementation Planning**
   - Created 4-week implementation plan at [planning/camadb_backend_implementation_plan.md]
   - Broke down work into 4 phases
   - Identified risks and success criteria
   - Defined testing strategy

4. **Context Network Updates**
   - Created backend key locations reference at [architecture/backend_key_locations.md]
   - Updated component map to include CamaDB in planned additions
   - Updated roadmap to include CamaDB backend in Phase 4
   - Linked all documents appropriately

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Document-Based Storage**: Store files as documents with rich metadata rather than simple key-value pairs
2. **MongoDB-Style Queries**: Leverage CamaDB's query language for advanced file searches
3. **Multi-Adapter Support**: Design to work with fs, IndexedDB, localStorage, and in-memory adapters
4. **Index Strategy**: Primary index on path, secondary on parent directory, optional on metadata
5. **Extension Features**: Include tagging, aggregations, and versioning as CamaDB-specific enhancements

### Technical Insights

1. **CamaDB Benefits**:
   - Pure TypeScript implementation (no native dependencies)
   - MongoDB-compatible query language via SiftJS
   - Multiple persistence adapters for different environments
   - Built-in indexing and aggregation support
   - Handles up to 1 million rows efficiently

2. **Integration Approach**:
   - Implement standard BackendInterface
   - Add CamaDB-specific extension methods
   - Use existing security and logging infrastructure
   - Follow established error handling patterns

3. **Challenges Identified**:
   - Need to handle Buffer storage efficiently
   - Directory operations require parent-child tracking
   - Performance optimization for large datasets
   - Testing across multiple environments

### Follow-Up Items

1. **Implementation Prerequisites**:
   - Add CamaDB to package.json dependencies
   - Set up development environment
   - Create feature branch

2. **Testing Requirements**:
   - Unit tests for all interface methods
   - Integration tests with real CamaDB
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Multi-environment testing

3. **Documentation Needs**:
   - API documentation for CamaDB-specific features
   - Migration guide from other backends
   - Performance characteristics guide

### Lessons Learned

1. **Architecture Flexibility**: PackFS's clean backend interface makes adding new storage options straightforward
2. **Document Databases Fit**: Document-based storage aligns well with filesystem semantics
3. **Query Power**: MongoDB-style queries enable powerful file search capabilities beyond traditional filesystems
4. **Environment Portability**: CamaDB's adapter system matches PackFS's multi-environment goals
