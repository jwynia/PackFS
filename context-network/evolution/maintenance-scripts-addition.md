# Maintenance Scripts Addition

**Date**: 2025-06-20
**Version**: Post-v0.1.20

## What Was Added

### Problem
Constant repetition of discovery tasks:
- Running grep/find commands to locate files
- Searching for test coverage information
- Guessing at external API signatures (Mastra, LangChain)
- Manually tracking feature implementation status
- No central reference for project structure

### Solution
Created comprehensive maintenance scripts that automatically generate reference documentation:

1. **update-context-network.js**
   - Generates file tree listings
   - Extracts all test cases from test files
   - Documents all exports from index.ts
   - Lists dependencies with versions

2. **extract-external-docs.js**
   - Extracts TypeScript definitions from dependencies
   - Creates Mastra API reference with all tools
   - Documents NPM scripts with descriptions
   - Provides ready-to-use examples

3. **feature-status.js**
   - Analyzes feature implementation completeness
   - Tracks implementation, tests, and exports
   - Generates actionable reports
   - Identifies features needing attention

## Benefits Realized

1. **Instant Answers**: No more searching for basic information
   - "What tests exist?" → Check `/reference/tests/all-tests.md`
   - "What's the Mastra API?" → Check `/reference/external/mastra-api.md`
   - "What's implemented?" → Check `/reference/status/features.md`

2. **Always Current**: Run `npm run maintenance` to regenerate everything

3. **Better Planning**: Feature status reports show exactly what needs work

4. **Reduced Token Usage**: LLMs can reference documentation instead of searching

## Usage Pattern

```bash
# Daily maintenance
npm run maintenance

# Quick updates after changes
npm run update-context

# Check external APIs
npm run extract-docs

# See what needs work
npm run feature-status
```

## Key Insight

> "Let's build doors instead of hammering through walls"

Rather than repeatedly discovering information through searches and commands, we now maintain a comprehensive reference that can be quickly consulted. This is especially valuable for:
- LLM agents that need quick access to project information
- New contributors understanding the codebase
- Planning work based on implementation status
- Avoiding repeated discovery of the same information

## Files Created

### Generated References (in context-network)
- `/reference/filetree/current.md`
- `/reference/tests/all-tests.md`
- `/reference/api/exports.md`
- `/reference/dependencies/current.md`
- `/reference/external/type-definitions.md`

## Next Steps

1. Add to CI pipeline for automatic updates
2. Create additional extractors for:
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Security audit results
   - Code complexity metrics
3. Build change detection to highlight what's new
4. Create visual dashboards from the data
